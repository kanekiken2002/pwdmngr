# Password Manager Project Plan

## Plan

1. Find a good code editor with features that turn markdown documents like these accessible.
2. Install MySQL.
3. Code!
4. Take a break, maybe?
5. Sometimes wish I'd never been born at all, dhaan dhanaananannanannana...
6. Lol.
7. Get distracted for the 25th time.
8. Make a coding plan before peeing, actually.
9. Humor? That's a defense mechanism.
10. Nothing really matters to me, after all.
11. Wiz Khalifa.

## Project Infrastructure

Maybe it's called that, but I don't know. Anyways, the components of the program are:

1. Backend: Python, with MySQL Connector module.
2. Frontend: Tkinter/Pygame.

Should be simple and sweet and can be adapted to higher levels with better graphical infrastructures later on.

## Backend

Let's start with the backend since that's more fun and obviously where you start.

Wait, what?? How do I know what to do backend for if I haven't decided what I want my password manager to do? Aight, let's go.

## Decide what you want the code to do

Now it's time to decide the requirements:

1. To store usernames and passwords.
2. To get them from my Brave user data.
3. Suggest new passwords for new accounts and store them when created.

## Infrastructure

### Backend

1. Create a MySQL database and tables to store the passwords.
2. Use the MySQL Connector module to connect to the database.
3. Implement functions for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the passwords table.
